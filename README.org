/Canvas Rendered EDitor/

* Why
There are [[https://github.com/showcases/text-editors][text editors]] already, [[http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/][even for Chrome OS]].  Why another?

- learn from other implementations (Spacemacs, Ace, Sublime Text, etc.)
- unique rendering mode
- reinvent ALL THE WHEELS!
- but really: Spacemacs for the web
  
* Features
...in various amounts of implementation

** render to HTML5 canvas
This [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/12437275/2037637][may be crazy]].  But it's part of the acronym, so it stays.

** game loop: separate concerns, smooth UI
- =while(true){input(),logic(),render()}=
- service =inputs= immediately
- update =logic= at fixed time steps for smoother animations
- =render= webGL possible; 2d still offers finer grained control and faster redraws than DOM

** layered, modal, keyboard-driven input
- =normal=, =insert=, =visual= modes like Vim
- popup mini-modes like Spacemacs
