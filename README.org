ChRome app text EDitor.  Spacemacs-inspired UI (key sequences instead of chords).

* Feature Wishlist

** game loop enforced separation of concerns
- basically `while(true){input(),logic(),render()}`
- service `input`s immediately
- `logic` update on fixed time steps (better animations)
- `render` only what's visible, possibly prerendering during scrolling

** nested modal input
- `normal`, `insert`, `visual` modes like Vim
- `SPC y z` runs command `z` from subgroup `y`
- incomplete commands pop-up a help menu

** RRB-trees for text, markup
- simplifies undo/redo
- 
** render to HTML5 canvas
- possibly webGL
