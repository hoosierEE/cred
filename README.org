ChRome app text EDitor.  Spacemacs-inspired UI (key sequences instead of chords).

* Feature Wishlist
None of these exist yet.

** game loop: smooth UI, separated concerns
- basically =while(true){input(),logic(),render()}=
- service =input= immediately
- update =logic= at fixed time steps for smoother animations
- =render= only what is visible, potential prerender during scrolling (machine learning?)

** nested modal input
- =normal=, =insert=, =visual= modes like Vim
- =SPC y z= runs command =z= from subgroup =y=
- incomplete commands pop-up a help menu

** RRB-trees for text, markup
- simple undo/redo

** render to HTML5 canvas
- webGL?
