/Canvas Rendered EDitor/

* Why
There are [[https://github.com/showcases/text-editors][text editors]] already, [[http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/][even for Chrome OS]].  Why another?

- learn from other implementations (Spacemacs, Ace, Sublime Text, etc.)
- unique rendering mode
- reinvent +ALL+ Some of the wheels!
- but really: Spacemacs for the web
  
* Features
...in various amounts of implementation

** render to HTML5 canvas
This [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/12437275/2037637][may be crazy]].  But it's part of the acronym, so it stays.

** game loop: separate concerns, smooth UI
- =while(true){input(),logic(),render()}=
- service =inputs= immediately
- update =logic= at fixed time steps for smoother animations
- =render= webGL possible; 2d still offers finer grained control and faster redraws than DOM

** layered, modal, keyboard-driven input
- =normal=, =insert=, =visual= modes like Vim
- popup mini-modes like Spacemacs

** License
License is [[http://unlicense.org/][the unlicense]], which is about as permissive as I've found while still looking official.

** Coding Style
Some inspiration for this style comes from this [[http://nsl.com/papers/style.pdf][K style guide]].

Other conventions:

- ALL_CAPS_CONSTANTS
- ProperCamelCaseClasses
- rarely_used_name_snake_case
- cu // commonly used name with a comment

I also somewhat hand-minify code when I consider it to be stable.  Below is an in-progres snippet:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
// ...
        do_last_thing();
    }
};

#+END_SRC

...and here's what it would look like when "done":

#+BEGIN_SRC js
// ...
        do_last_thing();}};

#+END_SRC

That said, I think that I'm not zealous about style, and am open to change.
