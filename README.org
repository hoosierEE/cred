ChRome app text EDitor.  Spacemacs-inspired UI (key sequences instead of chords).

* Why
There exist [[https://github.com/showcases/text-editors][good text editors]] already, [[http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/][even for Chrome OS]].  Why another?

- educational value - apply some techniques I've used in other software (and firmware) to editing text
- experiment with technology - RRB trees, canvas rendering, webGL
- build an extensible system (prolly invent a new language for this, because that sounds like a good use of time)
- learn from other implementations (Spacemacs, Ace, Sublime Text, etc.)
- portability of Chrome apps is better than native (runs on Chrome OS, for instance)

But really mostly for bragging about and because I want a copy of Spacemacs that runs in a browser.

* Implementation Details
None of these exist yet.

** game loop: smooth UI, separated concerns
- basically =while(true){input(),logic(),render()}=
- service =input= immediately
- update =logic= at fixed time steps for smoother animations
- =render= only what is visible, potential prerender during scrolling (machine learning?)

** nested modal input
- =normal=, =insert=, =visual= modes like Vim
- =SPC y z= runs command =z= from subgroup =y=
- incomplete commands pop-up a help menu

** RRB-trees for text, markup
- simple undo/redo
 
** render to HTML5 canvas
- webGL?
