/Canvas Rendered EDitor/

* Why
There are [[https://github.com/showcases/text-editors][text editors]] already, [[http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/][even for Chrome OS]].  Why another?

- educational, experimental
- learn from other implementations (Spacemacs, Ace, Sublime Text, etc.) 
- but really: Spacemacs for the web

* Features
...in various amounts of implementation

** render to HTML5 canvas
[[http://stackoverflow.com/a/12437275/2037637][This may be crazy]].  But graphics primitives are kind of fun, and there's something about immediate-mode rendering that I like.  Besides, virtual-dom-style rendering is the new hotness these days, and it's basically immediate-mode rendering behind the scenes.  So perhaps there are style points to be had for rendering to canvas.

** game loop: separate concerns, smooth UI
- =while(true){input(),logic(),render()}=
- service =inputs= immediately
- update =logic= at fixed time steps for smoother animations
- =render= only what is visible, potential prerender during scrolling (machine learning?)

** nested modal input
- =normal=, =insert=, =visual= modes like Vim
- =SPC y z= runs command =z= from subgroup =y=
- incomplete commands pop-up a help menu
